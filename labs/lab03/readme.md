In this lab, you are expected to make a geovisualization, which can be either storymap or coordinated view. Before you make your own geoviz, please please go over and start with emulate the  templates below.

- [Storymap Tutorial](storymap/readme.md), [Example 1](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog4572/labs/lab05/storymap/index.html), [Example 2](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog4572/labs/lab05/storymap/helloworld.html)

- [Coordianted View Tutorial](coordinated/readme.md), [Example](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog4572/labs/lab05/coordinated/index.html)


To help you choose a type of geovisualization to work on, we encouarge

- students to work on a geovisualization which is as the same type as the final project.

- Students who have already taken GEOG 371 (Web Mapping) to work on a coordinated view.

However, students can freely pick up either type of geoviz they feel interested in.

### Below  is the grading criteria:

#### *If you want to develop a coordinated-view*

- In the readme file, please describe your geovisualization. Especially, what specific pattern(s) you have observed through the coordianted view, and how the multiple charts and map helped you to find that pattern. (**8 POINTS**)

- At least three charts and a coordinated map; (**8 POINTS**)

- Because you have used several charts to show multiple dimensions of a geographic phenomonon. Please appy ~~[a bivariate color ramp for your map as well as your charts](http://geoviz.ceoas.oregonstate.edu/storymap/color.html)~~ **Please use the same color scheme for your map and charts.** (**8 POINTS**)

- At least two types of map layers (e.g., tileLayer, geojson layer). These layers can be made by yourself or from other web map providers; (**6 POINTS**)

#### *If you want to develop a Storymap*

- In the readme file, please describe the storyline of your story map. You may refer to the lecture notes on three-action (step, confrantation, and resolution) or five-action storytelling structures. (**8 POINTS**)

- At least 5 scenes. The content of the scenes can be obtained from Internet, historical archives, or even writing up by yourself. If you would like to use an external sources, please do mention their contribution in your credits information; (**8 POINTS**)

- At least two types of map layers (e.g., tileLayer or geojson layer). These layers can be made by yourself or from other web map providers; (**7 POINTS**)

- A video or image on the front or end page; (**7 POINTS**)

<hr>

Both the coordinated view and storymap should at least include the following components.

- A favicon; (**4 POINTS**)

- customized fonts from Google fonts; (**4 POINTS**)

- A social media button to share the storymap to Facebook or Twitter; #### If you want to generate a Storymap. (**2 POINTS**)

- credit information or acknowledgement; (**2 POINTS**)

- A github button linking to your github repository. (**2 POINTS**)

The structure of your github repository should like something below. (**6 POINTS**)

```Powershell

## 3. Deliverable

Once you complete this lab assignment, please make sure both the github repository and the web site work appropriately. Then, you will need to submit the url of the GitHub repository to **Canvas Dropbox**. (On the assignment tab,  press the `Submit Assignment` button to submit. Please contact the instructor or TA if you have any difficulty.)
