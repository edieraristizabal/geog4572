This assignment asks you to show what kind of geoviz application you are interested in. The geoviz you will show in this assignment should be as the same geoviz type (e.g., storymap, single view, coordinated-view, etc.) as the final project you would like to work on. For the deliverable, please create a powerpoint slide. In this one-page slide, you need to include the following information:

- (1) the url link of the geoviz you are interested in;

- (2) A screenshot of the geoviz;

- (3) A short description of the geoviz project that you planned to work on.  **Think bold!** In the meantime, please keep in mind that this course is more about honing the geovisual analytical skills other than concentrating on a specific topic.

- (4) The type of the geoviz that you plan to work. It should be one of the following: storymap, single view, coordinated multiple view, or point cloud geoviz.
