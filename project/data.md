# Data Source Table (Optional)

In the github repository for your final project:

- please make a table to list all the data sources for your final project In the `readme.md` file. If your final project is in a story map format, please also list the photos, videos, archives, newspapers and any other data you would like to visualize in the map. Regarding each row of data source, it should include the name, description, url link, memo, and etc.; and

- Please organize the geospatial data in ArcGIS or QGIS, and take a screenshot of Arc or Q's GUI(graphic user interface) when all the geospatial data are added on, and then put this screenshot to the `readme.md` file. (usually images will be saved in a folder named as `img` or `assets`).

> Note: **Make a data source table will help you organize your project**

Once you finish this homework, one member of your group need to submit the url of the created repository to Canvas Dropbox by 11:59pm of April 30th (Tuesday).
