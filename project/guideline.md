# Final Project Guidelines

The final project is a major component of this course. For each group, there should be no more than four students. I recommend a group should be formed by graduate and undergraduate students. Each group will collaboratively work on a final project using geovisual analytics. **Although the project topic is important, this project is more about how to apply the geovisual skills. ** So,students who want to team up as a group need to have a consensus that they are interested in using the similar geovisual tools and methods.


The projects are expected to have **advanced interactive features**, **an introductory page** and **(other additional materials)**. All the final projects are expected to **publish online**, and the **codes are expected to be shared on GitHub** to contribute to both the open source community and academia.

## 1\. Requirement

The final project can be simple and focused in nature, but must include:

- Host your geovisualization project on github; Then the geoviz eventually can be visited via a url link such as `[username].github.io/[repo_name]`.

- The map element of your project should include several map elements, such as map title, map description, overview map, legend,  data source, credit, or acknowledgement.


- A `readme.md` describes your web map, including, but not limited to,
    - Project title
    - Project description
    - Project goal (such as, what is the message you want to deliver through the geoviz?)
    - Technical summary: You are required to explain (1) system architecture, (2) the main functions of your web map using **either screenshots of the web map or a code snippet of the function, and a concomitant description**.
    - Sketch
    - Design Scheme
    - Data source
    - Favicon
    - Applied libraries (e.g., Leaflet, D3, DC) and Web Services (e.g., github, basemap) in use
    - Credit
    - Acknowledgement
    - Other things necessary to inform the audience of your Geoviz.

> **Note:** You are encouraged, *but not required*, to add a code snippet of Google Web Analytics to your geoviz.

## 2\. Presentation and peer review

Academics often attend conferences where they share their discoveries and browse the work of others to gain new ideas and offer feedback. on **June 11th at 1pm**, we will hold a final presentation meeting at 361 Strand Hall (the GAZE lab). Each team is expected to present their final project in ~10 minutes. And there will be a F&A session in 2 ~ 3 minutes. During the final presentation, each student will need to review all final projects and submit your review notes.

Additionally, you will need to submit **peer review form** for each project right after the presentation meeting.


## 3\. Team member peer review

In order to assess the contribution of each group member to the final project, you will need to review the contributions from both your team members and you. All the reviews should be combined as a sinple review report in pdf or word document. Please submit all the reviews to a dedicated canvas dropbox **(by 5:00pm on June 13th, Wednesday)**.


## 4\. Submission

To submit your final project, please just use the url link of your final project's github repository to a dedicaed final project submission tab on Canvas. **(by 5:00pm on June 12th, Tueday)**.


>  **Note:** The requirements to the final project may be slightly changed according the progress of this course. The final requirements are subject to the instructor's notification.
